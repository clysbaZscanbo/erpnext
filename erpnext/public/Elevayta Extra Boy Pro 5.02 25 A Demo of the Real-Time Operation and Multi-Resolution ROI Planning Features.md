Elevayta Extra Boy Pro 5.02 25 is a powerful tool that can be used to isolate, remove, suppress or enhance any part of a stereo audio track. It operates in real-time and is not restricted to vocal processing only. It also incorporates a unique 2D Spectral-Spatial editing mode by which individual instruments, having been visually identified by their Spectral-Spatial graphical signature, can simply be deleted from the mix. Alternatively, an instrument that needs a boost can be boosted by simply drawing a Region of Interest (ROI) around its Spectral-Spatial signature and increasing the gain in that part of the mix. Multiple ROIs can be drawn and deleted independently. This provides the capability to delete, isolate or boost multiple instruments[^1^] [^2^].
  
In this article, we will show you how to use Elevayta Extra Boy Pro 5.02 25 to perform various manipulations on a stereo audio track. We will use an original segment of stereo audio material as an example. You can download the original audio file and the preset bank for Extra Boy Pro from the links below:
 
**Download File â˜‘ [https://gohhs.com/2uySCz](https://gohhs.com/2uySCz)**


  
- Original Arrangement (wav)
- Preset bank (fxb) for Extra Boy Pro (demo release only)

Make sure that your VST host application is running at 48kHz sample rate (this is important because this is the rate for which the presets are valid). Unzip and load the "look\_of\_love\_full.wav" file into a track in your host application. Load up Extra Boy Pro, either as an insert effect on the same track or as a master effect, and load in the "Demo\_Extra\_Boy\_Pro.fxb" preset bank. When you check the available presets, the top 9 will be able to demonstrate various removal and isolation possibilities, for this audio clip. Press play, on your host application, and browse through the presets to hear the effect on the audio clip.
  
## Removing Bass
  
To remove the bass from the audio clip, select the preset "Remove Bass". You will see that a ROI has been drawn around the low frequency region of the Spectral-Spatial display. This ROI has been set to "Remove" mode, which means that any sound within this region will be suppressed. You can adjust the size and shape of the ROI by dragging its corners or edges. You can also move it around by clicking and dragging inside it. You can delete it by right-clicking on it.
  
## Removing Percussion
  
To remove the percussion from the audio clip, select the preset "Remove Percussion". You will see that several ROIs have been drawn around different parts of the Spectral-Spatial display that correspond to different percussion sounds. These ROIs have also been set to "Remove" mode, which means that any sound within these regions will be suppressed. You can edit these ROIs individually or collectively by using the same methods as described above.
  
## Removing Piano
  
To remove the piano from the audio clip, select the preset "Remove Piano". You will see that a large ROI has been drawn around most of the mid frequency region of the Spectral-Spatial display. This ROI has also been set to "Remove" mode, which means that any sound within this region will be suppressed. You can edit this ROI by using the same methods as described above.
  
## Isolating Piano
  
To isolate the piano from the audio clip, select the preset "Isolate Piano". You will see that a large ROI has been drawn around most of the mid frequency region of the Spectral-Spatial display. This ROI has been set to "Isolate" mode, which means that any sound outside this region will be suppressed. You can edit this ROI by using the same methods as described above.
  
## Removing Vocal
  
To remove the vocal from the audio clip, select the preset "Remove Vocal". You will see that a small ROI has been drawn around a narrow frequency band in the high frequency region of the Spectral-Spatial display. This ROI has also
