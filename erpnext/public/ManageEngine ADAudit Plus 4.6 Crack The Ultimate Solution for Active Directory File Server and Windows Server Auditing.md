Windows Server is one of the most widely used platforms for hosting applications, databases, websites, and other critical services. However, it also faces various security threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, malware attacks, privilege abuse, and configuration changes. To protect your Windows Server environment from these risks, you need a comprehensive and reliable auditing solution that can monitor and report on all activities across your servers, workstations, file servers, Active Directory, and Azure AD.
