- Windows 10 support: Delphi 10 Seattle enables developers to quickly and easily update their VCL and FMX applications to Windows 10 with the new Windows 10 VCL Controls, Styles and WinRT/UWP services components. Delphi 10 Seattle also supports high-DPI awareness and 4K monitors, as well as Windows 10 styles and features like notifications and contracts.
- Android background services: Delphi 10 Seattle allows developers to create Android services that run in the background with Object Pascal code, without the need for Java or native code. This enables developers to extend the functionality of their Android applications with tasks that can run even when the app is not in the foreground.
- MongoDB support: Delphi 10 Seattle provides complete FireDAC support for the NoSQL MongoDB database, including a new FireDAC MongoDB driver, MongoDB specific datasets, JSON and BSON processing classes, MongoDB query and pipeline builders, and more. This allows developers to easily access and manipulate data stored in MongoDB collections with Delphi code.
- Beacon device support: Delphi 10 Seattle introduces a new TBeaconDevice class that can turn a device on one of the supported platforms (Windows, macOS, iOS or Android) into a âbeaconâ, which is a device that broadcasts a unique identifier using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This enables developers to create applications that can interact with other devices or users based on their proximity.
- IDE productivity enhancements: Delphi 10 Seattle delivers more developer productivity than ever around the daily activities of coding, building and debugging. In addition to enhanced multi-monitor support, the IDE can now access double the memory, so developers can build and debug large projects with ease. Delphi 10 Seattle also has integrated and improved performance with over 20 IDE productivity features, such as searchable Object Inspector, touch animation for Android platform, shortcuts to increase/decrease font size in code editor, and more.
